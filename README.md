# About this Repository
Every lab that was done in 1st year for Computer Science modules CS161/162

* I wanted to keep track of all assignments in case they were deleted at the end of the semester.
* All assignments were done through Java, which is the main language for 1<sup>st</sup> year.
* These assignments were done on an IDE called MULE which was created by Maynooth University.
